## How is the browser support? Does the feature work in all browsers?
So far, we have tested the site on the following browsers. You just need to enable location on your computer, and possibly on a per-browser basis.
Additionally, we have applied a [CSS prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to our CSS/SASS code. This ensures that if certain CSS features are not supported in certain browsers, they will still appear almost the same in a different way.
* ‚úÖ Chrome, works 
* ‚úÖ Safari, works 
* ‚úÖ Firefox, works 
* ‚úÖ Opera, works
